General idea is to survey cheminformatics applications in the cloud
as well as more generally, what classes of applications benefit from
cloud technologies. One focus of the paper is to try and list ``big
data'' problems in cheminformatics - if there are any.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Increase of big data in the sciences
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Highlight bioinformatics big data problems
    \item Discuss the issue of big data in chemistry
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Large public databases (Pubchem, GDB, etc)
      \item Applications using large chemical collections (virtual
        screening, \ldots)
      \item Highlight how many (most?) large scale cheminformatics applications can
        be solved by chunking
      \end{itemize}
    \item Discuss cloud technologies
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Large scale remote hosting
      \item Commercial benefits (?) - probably depends
      \item Hadoop and cheminformatics - discuss some examples
      \item Data grids (allowing all data to remain in memory)
      \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

\section*{Background}

Over the last few years, the life sciences have started with dealing
with ``big data'' problems, characterized by huge amounts of data
being generated by various high throughput experimental methods or
being collected in a variety of databases. Biological problems such as
next generation sequencing technologies generate huge amounts of data
that require large scale investments in hardware for storage and
subsequent analysis. Over the years, it has been realized that local
hardware installations may not be optimal for handling the
conputational loads associated with these types of problems and so the
role of remotely hosted computation resources (a.k.a, ``cloud
computing'') has grown significantly. 

There have been a number of bioinformatics applications that have
employed cloud resources in different ways. For example, the Bowtie
[REF] sequence alignment tool makes use of the Amazon EC2
infrastructure to parallelize the alignment algorithm. 

Cloud based resources are available from a number of commercial
vendors. In addition, open-source implementations of the software
components for cloud based infrastructures are also available [REF].
